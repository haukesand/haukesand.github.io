		Due to widespread usage of touchscreens users have accepted interaction
		without haptic feedback. Commercial game consoles have introduced users to
		touchless input and natural user interfaces. Only recently it has become
		technical possible to track human hand skeleton in high detail, precision and
		low latency contactless. This report describes the design process for the
		user experience, user interface and interaction interface of a touchless
		showcase using skeletal hand tracking. The project extends on existing
		hardware, compares current approaches, researches on the user group and
		rebuilds the software, based on these findings, from scratch. To allow input,
		multiple interactions and 3D buttons were developed. In a user experiment
		these were tested. A final prototype was implemented on two showcases for a
		month and compared to the existing software. The findings suggest that users
		want more natural and direct interactions. Missing physical feedback,
		non-existent depth perception on traditional screens and unfamiliar gesture
		language are hindrances but can be overcome with the use of good visual cues.
		Future work on the software is solely on refinement. Some of the interactions
		investigated in this thesis will prevail, while some might appear in other
		contexts.
