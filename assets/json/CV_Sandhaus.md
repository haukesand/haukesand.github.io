| **ㅡ Ongoing Projects** | ![][image5] **Benevolent User Interface Design**  Developing frameworks to counteract dark patterns with "bright patterns" that prioritize user goals and well-being over their desires and business objectives.  Created [brightpatterns.org](http://brightpatterns.org) to catalog and promote benevolent design solutions by corporations, seemingly acting against their short-term best interest.  Created the survey tool [UEEQ.or](http://UEEQ.org)[g](http://UEEQ.org) to quantify ethical user experience metrics to evaluate interface design. **Enabling Appropriate Dataflows**  Investigating methods to promote data sharing and transparency. Developing onboarding flows to encourage transparent data sharing that enables AI models for societal good. Researching large scale dataset privacy risks on groups and developing frameworks to enable use of them through contextual integrity. **Responsible AI Innovation** Auditing AI hardware for historical bias in measurement standards. Encouraging regulatory sandboxing in high-risk domains to enable innovation with appropriate guardrails.
