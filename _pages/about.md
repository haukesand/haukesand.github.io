Advised by the ascending [Qian Yang](https://qianyang.co/), and legendary [Wendy Ju](https://tech.cornell.edu/people/wendy-ju/).
Background in Human Computer Interaction (M.Sc.) & Creative Technology (B.Sc.). Worked as a UX technologist in the VW Group Future Center to improve mobility for all.

**Research Statement**: How do design methodologies need to evolve to meet the ethical challenges of data-intensive systems. Through two complementary threads, I investigate: (1) ethical data-driven interaction design, where I develop frameworks to evaluate user experiences and study how designers can responsibly leverage AI in their process; and (2) ethical data-sharing, where I create policies and tools that balance innovation needs with data protection across domains from autonomous vehicles, urban street imagery to healthcare.

Pre Ph.D. work can be seen at my [portfolio website](https://haukesandhaus.de/).
