Advised by the ascending [Qian Yang](https://qianyang.co/), and legendary [Wendy Ju](https://tech.cornell.edu/people/wendy-ju/).
Background in Human Computer Interaction (M.Sc.) & Creative Technology (B.Sc.). Worked as a UX technologist in the VW Group Future Center to improve mobility for all.

*Research Statement*: My research addresses how design methodologies must evolve to meet the ethical challenges of data-intensive systems. I develop empirical methods to measure ethical user experiences, create data-sharing frameworks, and build design tools that help technologists navigate the complex tensions between commercial pressures and human autonomy under increased automation.

Pre Ph.D. work can be seen at my [portfolio website](https://haukesandhaus.de/).
